# Book Mentors And Judges

You’ll need to recruit a variety of tech experts to mentor your attendees, speak at your event and judge your hackathon. Consider targeting:

* Experts from your school, including professors, deans, and alumni

* Local community leaders

* Reps from local tech companies

* Tech celebrities who have something to promote (best for bigger events)

Networking tips for recruiting speakers and judges:

* It’s similar to the process of [contacting sponsors](https://guide.mlh.io/Organizer-Timeline/4-Months-Before/Sponsorship/Land-Sponsorships.html).

* Consider who you know and who your school knows

* Have department heads reach out for you when helpful

## A Note About Judges

We recommend selecting judges that have a strong technical aptitude. If you’re planning to do Science Fair Judging and Presentations, your judges for each should be separate. For expo judging, ensure you have a minimum of one judge per thirty participants.

## MLH Mentor Matcher

As part of our mission to create an empowering environment where hackers of all skill levels can create amazing things, we’re launching the [MLH Mentor Matcher](https://mentors.mlh.io) - powered by [Twilio](https://twilio.com) to help connect the hackers and mentors at your event!

Did you know that on average 25% of the attendees who participated in the 2018  MLH hackathon season didn’t demo? Many of them got stuck on a bug that they didn’t know how to get past. Having access to a mentor could have helped them finish their project, but finding a mentor can be a challenge. It can be intimidating to approach a professional and ask for help, and sometimes mentors just aren’t around.

To address this issue, we partnered up with our friends at Twilio and built the MLH Mentor Matcher to connect the hackers and mentors at your event. Hackers will have access to a custom phone number that they can text whenever they have a question with a description and their location. Suddenly, a wild mentor will appear, ready to help and ensure that hacker has a great experience. Sign up here. 


## MLH Tips

* Start close to home. Often your best chances at hosting strong speakers will come from personal and school connections.

* Consider recruiting a high-energy MC. [This person will be the face of the event to hackers and sponsors, so having someone who is excited about hacking with some public speaking experience helps hold the entire event together.](http://news.mlh.io/how-to-throw-an-epic-hackathon-07-07-2014)
